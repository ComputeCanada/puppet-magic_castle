# mkproject.sh watches 389-ds access log for operations related to group
# matching a regex ($PROJECT_REGEX) with the intent of automatically
# manipulating Slurm accounts and folders under /project associated with these
# groups.

# Three operations are currently supported: ADD, MOD and DEL.
# - ADD triggers a creation of Slurm account and directory under /project
# - MOD triggers either the additions of users to the associated Slurm
#   accounts and their folder under /project/GID/`username`
#   or it triggers the removals of the users from the associated Slurm account
#   and the removal of the symlink from the users home to the project folder.
# - DEL trigger the removal of all users from the associated Slurm account
#   and the removal of the symlink to the project from all previous member
#   home folders.
